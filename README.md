# Restaurant Page

# About

This project is about making a simple home page of a restaurant dynamically and only using JavaScript.

# Goals

- Build page elements using only JavaScript
- Using the concept of **ES6 modules** in building a project
- Getting to know how to install and configure **webpack**
- Use **npm** to install the required packages in building the project
- Using webpack to bundle project modules including script files, CSS files and images

# Other concepts used

- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Transitions
- Events and Event Listeners
- Module Pattern
- IIFE

# Challenges

At first glance, getting to know new concepts such as webpack, ES6 modules and npm may be scary and confusing for the first time, which of course it is! For me, out of the three, setting up the webpack configuration file and understanding its various parts was the most challenging and confusing, and certainly not possible without reading its documentation. I learned what, for example, 'entry' and 'output' are, how different assets such as CSS files and images are processed, and in general, what is the task of each part of the configuration file. In the end, I realized that webpack is not that hard to understand. it just takes practice.
